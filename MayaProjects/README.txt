This is the folder structure for Maya projects

Characters
Environment
Props

When creating new project please place it in the respected folder. 

Example if you are creating a new character project place it in the Character folder. The same goes for props and environment.

This way we keep the consistency clean.

When you finish with the 3D model, please add the final version as FBX to the respected folder in Unity.
We have created the same folder structure in the Unity project so you can easily find it out.

For example Minigame1 (the Unity Project folder) -> Assets -> Characters  (or props or environment) -> Models ( or textures or shaders )

If you face any problems please contact the Pipeline programer
